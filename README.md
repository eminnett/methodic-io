The initial implementation of the public facing Methodic.io website is a simple single page placeholder. Rails is overkill for this sort of site, but the longer term goal is to incorporate Methodic.io as the public front-end of the Methodic Microservice Ecosystem (MME) once it is sufficiently mature. Rails will be a suitable framework once the richer functionality has been implemented.
